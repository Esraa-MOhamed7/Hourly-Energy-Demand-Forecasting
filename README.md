# ðŸ”‹ Hourly Energy Consumption Forecasting

Welcome to a full-cycle data science project where we analyze and forecast electricity demand using the PJME dataset. Our mission: to understand how energy consumption fluctuates over timeâ€”and to build accurate, interpretable models that predict future demand.

## Project Workflow

We follow a complete and modular data science pipeline:

### 1. Exploration
We begin by inspecting the dataset using `.head()` and `.shape` to understand its structure, size, and granularity.

### 2. Cleaning
We handle missing values, convert datetime formats, and reset the index to prepare the data for time-based modeling.

### 3. Feature Extraction
We engineer powerful time features:
- `Month`, `Year`, `Hour`, `DayOfWeek`, `Quarter`  
These help capture seasonal, weekly, and hourly demand patterns.

### 4. Analysis & Visualization
We explore demand trends using expressive plots:
- Line charts, boxplots, and seasonal breakdowns  
These visualizations reveal cyclical behavior and outliers.

### 5. Modeling
We train and compare multiple machine learning models:
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost

**XGBoost** and **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy with **RÂ² = 0.99**.

## Web App Overview

The deployed Streamlit app allows users to:
- Input time-based features interactively  
- Predict electricity demand in megawatts  
- View model performance and feature importance

The model is hosted on Google Drive and downloaded dynamically using `gdown`, keeping the app lightweight and reproducible.

##  Performance Metrics

We measure performance using:

- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error): `367.93`  
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error): `608.04`  
- **RÂ² Score**: `0.9911`

âœ… These results reflect high model accuracy, especially from XGBoost and Random Forest.
